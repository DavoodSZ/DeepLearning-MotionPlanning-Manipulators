# Paper List in the Survey Paper
Here is the list of papers we reviewed in our survey paper. We only list the papers presented in "Section V. Deep Learning in Planning for Robotic Manipulators" of the paper. The papers are listed based on the taxonomy in section V of the original paper.

- [End-to-end Planning](#end-to-end-planning): These papers utilize various deep learning frameworks for end-to-end Motion planning for robotic manipulators.
- [Sampling-based Motion Planning](#sampling-based-motion-planning): This group of papers utilizes deep learning to improve the informed sampling primitive and steering primitive of classical sampling-based motion planning algorithms.
- [Constrained Sampling-based Motion Planning](#constrained-sampling-based-motion-planning): This group of papers utilizes deep learning for learning the geometric constraint manifolds for effective on-manifold sample generation.
- [Trajectory Optimization](#trajectory-optimization): This group of papers utilizes deep learning to warm-start the global trajectory optimization problem.
- [Collision Checking](#collision-checking): This group of papers utilizes deep learning for collision querying and collision checking within classical motion planning algorithms.

This list will be continuously updated.
